For request: Enter the link localhost:3000 into your browser and it will take you to the main html page where you can signup and login using the two buttons on the page this will redirect you to either localhost:3000/signup or localhost:3000/login.

For response: Entering localhost:3000, localhost:3000/signup, or localhost:3000/login will give back to the user the data for the html pages that will allow them to signup and login.

To use my program effectively send the user to localhost:3000, but before that make sure to start up the server using node server.js and make sure Express is downlowaded.
